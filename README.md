# Library Management System C++

# Project Overview:
The Library Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows admins and students to manage library resources effectively. The system enables students to access the library data. Admins have the ability to manage the books and students' accounts. The system supports adding and viewing books, as well as managing student accounts.

# Admin Functions:
1. Add a book to the system: The admin can add new books to the library.
2. View the status of books: The admin can view the list and availability of books in the library.
3. Search for the book: (by titles, author)
4. View enrolled students: The admin can view the list of students registered in the system and their book balance
   
# Student Functions:
  1. Create an account: A new student can register by providing their roll number, name, address
  2. View balance: Students can view their book balance.

Data storage: The system uses 2D arrays to store the details of students and books. Initially, 10 books are stored in the library. Each student account contains the roll number, balance and first name.
